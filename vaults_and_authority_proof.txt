$ACKE CLMM Vault Ownership (No Withdrawal Possible)

There are two vault accounts that hold the actual assets in the liquidity pool:

1) ACKE token vault:
   rySKvP1HEdwatCRdchAwGYwAoR9mRt3LhPbFAiorsap

2) WSOL vault:
   7eLA8C4LFHNGD8Rh9awGuSbGBu3zuhWeZtrQwviicujN

Both vaults are controlled by the same PDA chain that owns the CLMM position:
   GJyxRzHHRS7aGZP8kz8PZMDCHVn7CyDrEVfHRZDt5t5J

No private keys exist for this address (ed25519_is_on_curve == false).

This means:

- No wallet can sign to move funds from either vault
- No multisig can be added to authorize movements
- No withdrawal instruction exists in the controlling program (Rocket Launcher)
- Even the deployer cannot modify, transfer, or reclaim liquidity

In short:
The vaults are locked by code, not by human promises. No one can drain the pool.
