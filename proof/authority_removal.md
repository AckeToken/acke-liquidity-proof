## Final Authority State
Mint Authority: None
Freeze Authority: None
Pool/Account Auth: None

### Meaning
- **No minting** can ever occur (fixed supply)
- **No freezing** of accounts is possible
- **No reclaim / transfer of pool ownership**
- **No administrative override** exists

**Result:** Token + liquidity configuration is **final and irreversible**.
