$ACKE Authority Removal Proof (Immutable Token Supply)

The $ACKE token mint originally had standard authorities (mint + freeze).
These were permanently removed using Solana's SetAuthority instruction.

Authority final state (on-chain):

Mint Authority:      None
Freeze Authority:    None

This means:
- The token supply cannot increase (no minting)
- No wallet or contract can freeze addresses
- No new permissions can be assigned
- No reclaim / reissue / recovery / override is possible

The $ACKE token is final and immutable. There is no owner.
